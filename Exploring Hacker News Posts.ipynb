Hacker News is a website started by the startup incubator Y Combinator, where user-submitted stories (known as \"posts\") are voted and commented upon, similar to reddit. Hacker News is extremely popular in technology and startup circles, and posts that make it to the top of Hacker News' listings can get hundreds of thousands of visitors as a result.\n",

    "We are interested to find the best times (hour) to post for Ask and Show Post in Hacker News Post since both of those have title with *Ask HN* or *Show HN* before the topic so it's easy to differentiate. Ask HN is used to ask HN community about specific question, while users will submit Show HN post when they want to show something they've created.  \n",
